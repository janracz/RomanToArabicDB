## General info
This project was made for my studies as an exercise for my studies. It's an extend of previous version. This application imitates a simple web page. It's used to convert roman numbers into arabic numbers. First the user have to log in. If he hasn't got an account he have to sign in. After that he can log in and at the page he can either convert a number or check a history of conversion. This project helped me to understand servlets and some database managment.
